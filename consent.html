      <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Key Information about this research study</h2>
      <p class="mb-3">The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether to be a part of this study. Information that is more detailed is explained later on in this form.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate high-quality research proposals in interdisciplinary fields.</li>
        <li>You will be asked to review 3 anonymized research proposals and complete a short questionnaire rating each on novelty, clarity, and feasibility.</li>
        <li>We expect that you will be in this research study for about 45–60 minutes total.</li>
        <li>The primary potential risk of participation is a potential loss of confidentiality, which we will minimize through secure data handling.</li>
        <li>There are no direct benefits, though your insights may inform future innovation tools.</li>
      </ul>
